    "You should use Aanaconda if you plan to do future research that involves informatics. It is a package manager with better support for ensuring your python package dependencies, ensuring they work more consistently; however, [PIP](#pip) is easier to use out of the box without additional installation.\n",

    "If you installed Anaconda, skip this section. Otherwise we'll be using PIP. It's a bit easier at first but is more brittle and not as good a choice for research. We will need to set up a virtual environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is best practice to set up a 'virtual environment' where python modules will be installed in an isolated space on your computer that we can eventually delete without affecting your computer in a larger scale. \n",
